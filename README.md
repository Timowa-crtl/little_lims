# LittleLIMS

## Description

LittleLIMS is a lightweight Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) web application designed to manage projects and samples in a laboratory setting. It allows users to keep track of a database of customers, projects and samples.

### Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register for an account, log in, and log out.
- **Customer Management**: Users can view a list of customers and create new customers.
- **Project Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete projects, specifying details such as workflow type, status, and associated customer.
- **Sample Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete samples within projects, providing sample names, customer labels, and statuses.
- **CSV Import**: Users can import project and sample data from CSV files for bulk data entry.

### Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Python-based web framework used for building the backend of the application. Building the backend with fastAPI was explored but ease of use and flexibility of Flask proved to be the best option for LittleLIMS.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight SQL database engine used for data storage.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend templates and stylesheets for rendering web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Used for client-side scripting, particularly for filtering tables, form validation, and confirmation dialogs.
- **CS50 Library**: Provided functionality for interacting with SQLite databases.
- **Pandas**: Python library used for data manipulation, particularly for reading and processing CSV files.
